Our project helps prospective college applicants to find schools which match their preferences. Students can search for colleges based on location, tuition, and a variety of other aspects. Our web application also allows students to enter in their own academic data and find schools that fit their academic level.

Usefullness:

In 2019, there were about 2.9 million first-time freshmen in colleges around the country. Most of these freshmen applied to many different schools, not knowing which ones they would get into. Since the goal of this application is to better match students with schools, this is very useful for the millions of high school applicants who are unsure of what schools to apply to.

Functionality:

Create Account - Users can create an account and update their profiles with test scores and extracurriculars.
 
Login - Users can login to their account so they can keep their information between sessions.
 
Logout - Users can log out of their account.
 
ACT/SAT/GPA/Extracurriculars - Users can add theyâ€™re ACT, SAT, and GPA statistics as well as extracurricular activities which are used to determine what schools they are likely to be accepted into.
 
Search Schools - Users can search through thousands of schools based on their preferences, including location, tuition, size and other factors.
 
Search Safety/Match/Reach Schools - If users have added information to their profile, they can search through colleges which would be a good fit. They have the option to select schools they are very likely to get into (safety), those that would be a comfortable fit (match), and those which are unlikely yet possible to get into (reach).
 
View Schools Applied - Users can view the schools they have applied to by going to the Schools Applied page. It will also show the status of the application (pending, waitlisted, accepted, or rejected).
